If you're reading this, I certainly hope the future is treating you and everyone else much better. 
This application was written by me (Adam Kim with assistance from Alex Goodman) during the middle 
of the CoVID-19 pandemic and my first month at JT4. Things have been interesting to say the least 
and life has not been the smoothest, but this opportunity serves as the start of a new chapter in 
my life and I hope that leads to more stable and happier times. I hope this application finds a 
home where it'll be used and loved, because at the end of the day I enjoy writing code to help others. 
I want to dedicate this project to my parents, who have given me a wonderful life filled with opportunity 
and love. Without them I wouldn't be sitting here today. Thank you Mom and Dad, I love you. To Pepper: 
You gave one of your nine lives to save mine, I hope I can use this second chance to reciprocate the 
love that you gave me. I'll always love and miss you.
